# Subcontractor-Monitoring-System

This git repository contains files for a subcontractor monitoring system used by Site Staff to ensure that Subcontractors are completing their works to a saisfactory level before being paid.

The software was created using .NET Framework. 

If I remade the project again I would put more consideration into good practices like separation of concerns and dependency injection.

Code Highlights:
